    occurs in [s2] (which matches [Star re]).  This is a good
    illustration of why we need induction on evidence for [exp_match],
    as opposed to [re]: The latter would only provide an induction

(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it happily lets you try to set up an induction over a term
    that isn't sufficiently general.  The net effect of this will be
    to lose information (much as [destruct] can do), and leave you
    unable to complete the proof. Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in the
    recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction. Here is a naive
    first attempt: *)

  induction H1
    as [|x'|s1 re1 s2' re2 Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2
        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect from the
    definition of [exp_match]), we lost a very important bit of
    information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something of the
    form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for _all_
    seven constructors of this definition, even though all but two of
    them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can still
    get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H.

(** ... but most of them get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show that
    s2 =~ Char x' -> x' :: s2 =~ Char x',
    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. Stuck... *)

Abort.

(** The problem is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis only works
    properly with hypotheses that are completely general, i.e., ones
    in which all the arguments are variables, as opposed to more
    complex expressions, such as [Star re].  In this respect it
    behaves more like [destruct] than like [inversion].

    We can solve this problem by generalizing over the problematic
    expressions with an explicit equality: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ re' ->
  re' = Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence directly,
    because the argument to the first hypothesis is sufficiently
    general, which means that we can discharge most cases by inverting
    the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This idiom is so common that Coq provides a tactic to
    automatically generate such equations for us, avoiding thus the
    need for changing the statements of our theorems.  Calling
    [remember e as x] causes Coq to (1) replace all occurrences of the
    expression [e] by the variable [x], and (2) add an equation [x =
    e] to the context.  Here's how we can use it to show the above
    result: *)

Abort.

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (pumping)  *)

Module Pumping.

(** One of the first interesting theorems in the theory of regular
    expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which states,
    informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching a
    regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re]. *)

(** To begin, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we are
    working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able to
    calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

Fixpoint pumping_constant {T} (re : reg_exp T) : nat :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => 0
  | EmptyStr => 1
  | Char _ => 2
  | App re1 re2 =>
      pumping_constant re1 + pumping_constant re2
  | Union re1 re2 =>
      pumping_constant re1 + pumping_constant re2
  | Star _ => 1
  end.

(** Next, it is useful to define an auxiliary function that repeats a
    string (appends it to itself) some number of times. *)

Fixpoint napp {T} (n : nat) (l : list T) : list T :=
  match n with
  | 0 => []
  | S n' => l ++ napp n' l
  end.

Lemma napp_plus: forall T (n m : nat) (l : list T),
  napp (n + m) l = napp n l ++ napp m l.
Proof.
  intros T n m l.
  induction n as [|n IHn].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHn, app_assoc. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Now, the pumping lemma itself says that, if [s =~ re] and if the
    length of [s] is at least the pumping constant of [re], then [s]
    can be split into three substrings [s1 ++ s2 ++ s3] in such a way
    that [s2] can be repeated any number of times and the result, when
    combined with [s1] and [s3] will still match [re].  Since [s2] is
    also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us
    a (constructive!) way to generate strings matching [re] that are
    as long as we like. *)

Lemma pumping : forall T (re : reg_exp T) s,

  pumping_constant re <= length s ->
  exists s1 s2 s3,
    s = s1 ++ s2 ++ s3 /\

    forall m, s1 ++ napp m s2 ++ s3 =~ re.

(** To streamline the proof (which you are to fill in), the [omega]
    tactic, which is enabled by the following [Require], is helpful in
    several places for automatically completing tedious low-level
    arguments involving equalities or inequalities over natural

(** * Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen in the [Logic] chapter that we often need to
    relate boolean computations to statements in
    [Prop]. Unfortunately, performing this conversion by hand can
    result in tedious proof scripts. Consider the proof of the
    following theorem: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (beq_nat n) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (beq_nat n m) eqn:H.
    + (* beq_nat n m = true *)
      intros _. rewrite beq_nat_true_iff in H. rewrite H.
      left. reflexivity.
    + (* beq_nat n m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** In the first branch after [destruct], we explicitly
    apply the [beq_nat_true_iff] lemma to the equation generated by
    destructing [beq_nat n m], to convert the assumption [beq_nat n m
    = true] into the assumption [n = m], which is what we need to
    complete this case.

    We can streamline this proof by defining an inductive proposition
    that yields a better case-analysis principle for [beq_nat n
    m].  Instead of generating an equation such as [beq_nat n m =
    true], which is not directly useful, this principle gives us right
    away the assumption we need: [n = m].  We'll actually define
    something a bit more general, which can be used with arbitrary
    properties (and not just equalities): *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
| ReflectT : P -> reflect P true
| ReflectF : ~ P -> reflect P false.

(** The [reflect] property takes two arguments: a proposition
    [P] and a boolean [b].  Intuitively, it states that the property
    [P] is _reflected_ in (i.e., equivalent to) the boolean [b]: [P]
    holds if and only if [b = true].  To see this, notice that, by
    definition, the only way we can produce evidence that [reflect P
    true] holds is by showing that [P] is true and using the
    [ReflectT] constructor.  If we invert this statement, this means
    that it should be possible to extract evidence for [P] from a
    proof of [reflect P true].  Conversely, the only way to show
    [reflect P false] is by combining evidence for [~ P] with the
    [ReflectF] constructor.

    It is easy to formalize this intuition and show that the two
    statements are indeed equivalent: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.
Proof.
  intros P [] H.
  - apply ReflectT. rewrite H. reflexivity.
  - apply ReflectF. rewrite H. intros H'. inversion H'.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, recommended (reflect_iff)  *)
Theorem reflect_iff : forall P b, reflect P b -> (P <-> b = true).
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** The advantage of [reflect] over the normal "if and only if"
    connective is that, by destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the
    form [reflect P b], we can perform case analysis on [b] while at
    the same time generating appropriate hypothesis in the two
    branches ([P] in the first subgoal and [~ P] in the second).

    To use [reflect] to produce a better proof of
    [filter_not_empty_In], we begin by recasting the
    [beq_nat_iff_true] lemma into a more convenient form in terms of
    [reflect]: *)

Lemma beq_natP : forall n m, reflect (n = m) (beq_nat n m).
Proof.
  intros n m.
  apply iff_reflect. rewrite beq_nat_true_iff. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** The new proof of [filter_not_empty_In] now goes as follows.
    Notice how the calls to [destruct] and [apply] are combined into a
    single call to [destruct].  (To see this clearly, look at the two
    proofs of [filter_not_empty_In] in your Coq browser and observe
    the differences in proof state at the beginning of the first case
    of the [destruct].) *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In' : forall n l,
  filter (beq_nat n) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (beq_natP n m) as [H | H].
    + (* n = m *)
      intros _. rewrite H. left. reflexivity.
    + (* n <> m *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** Although this technique arguably gives us only a small gain
    in convenience for this particular proof, using [reflect]
    consistently often leads to shorter and clearer proofs. We'll see
    many more examples where [reflect] comes in handy in later
    chapters.

    The use of the [reflect] property was popularized by _SSReflect_,
    a Coq library that has been used to formalize important results in
    mathematics, including as the 4-color theorem and the
    Feit-Thompson theorem.  The name SSReflect stands for _small-scale
    reflection_, i.e., the pervasive use of reflection to simplify
    small proof steps with boolean computations. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)  *)
(** Let's prove that our definition of [filter] from the [Poly]
    chapter matches an abstract specification.  Here is the
    specification, written out informally in English:

    A list [l] is an "in-order merge" of [l1] and [l2] if it contains
    all the same elements as [l1] and [l2], in the same order as [l1]
    and [l2], but possibly interleaved.  For example,
    [1;4;6;2;3]
    is an in-order merge of
    [1;6;2]
    and
    [4;3].
    Now, suppose we have a set [X], a function [test: X->bool], and a
    list [l] of type [list X].  Suppose further that [l] is an
    in-order merge of two lists, [l1] and [l2], such that every item
    in [l1] satisfies [test] and no item in [l2] satisfies test.  Then
    [filter test l = l1].

    Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove
    it.  (You'll need to begin by defining what it means for one list
    to be a merge of two others.  Do this with an inductive relation,
    not a [Fixpoint].)  *)
